This folder contains your own flows, that is:
 - new flows created from scratch
 - flows copied from the flows-generated folder
 
Remember, you should not edit directly the flows present in the flows-generated folder.
Instead you should copy the flow here, and then edit the copied version.
 
Spring Web Flow will first look up the flows into this folder. As a fall back it will
use the flows present in the flows-generated folder.
