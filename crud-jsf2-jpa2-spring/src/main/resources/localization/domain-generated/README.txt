This folder contains the properties you want to override.

Remember, you should not edit directly the properties files present in the src/main/resources/localization/domain-generated folder.
Instead if you want to override a property you should create a new properties file in this folder
and set the property to its desired value.

Don't forget to declare your new properties files in the Spring configuration file applicationContext.xml
